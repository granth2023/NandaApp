bumble BFF app? --> what language did Austin mention? 

scalable? 

process: 

PreBuild: 
Research + Wireframes + Proposal -> 


Build: 
-> Database: 
    * CRUD
    * Authentication
    * Deployment
    *testing

-> Middleware: 
    *What is? 

-> Frontend: 
    *connection strings 
    *testing
    *styling
    * deployment

* What is our MVP? 
* What does maintanence look like? 
* What is the goal? 
* What is your timeline? 
* what tech would oyu want to deploy on? 
* AWS? 
* App store? 
* How far in the project or process are you? 
* Do you know what you want it to look like?

we want to pick our tech - ios or android or cross - flutter
Flutter Setup: The team installs Flutter and configures it for both Android and iOS development, ensuring that the Dart SDK (which comes bundled with Flutter) is also set up.
Python and Django Setup: They set up a Python development environment, install Django, and create a new Django project to serve as the backend API.
PostgreSQL Setup: PostgreSQL is installed and configured. A new database is created for the app, and the necessary connections between Django and the database are established using Django's ORM.


Setting Up the Development Environment
Flutter Setup
Installation: The team installs Flutter by downloading it from the official Flutter website. This includes setting up Dart, which comes bundled with Flutter.
IDE Configuration: Developers configure their preferred IDEs—likely Visual Studio Code or Android Studio—with Flutter and Dart plugins to support Flutter development and debugging.
Device Setup: They set up emulators for both iOS and Android to test the app across different devices and screen sizes directly from their development machines.
Python and Django Setup
Python Installation: Python is installed, ensuring the version is compatible with the latest Django framework. Virtual environments are created using venv or virtualenv to manage dependencies cleanly.
Django Project Initialization: A new Django project is initiated with django-admin startproject, creating the project structure. This includes settings for development and production environments.
Database Configuration: Django is configured to connect to PostgreSQL by setting the database engine and credentials in settings.py. The team ensures that the psycopg2 library, a PostgreSQL adapter for Python, is installed.
PostgreSQL Setup
Installation: PostgreSQL is installed locally for development. Instructions vary by operating system, but all aim to ensure a running PostgreSQL server that can be accessed by the Django application.
Database Creation: Using PostgreSQL’s command-line tools, a new database is created for the app. Initial tables are not yet created; they will be generated by Django migrations based on the app's models.
Developing the Backend
Model Definition: Django models are defined for the core functionalities: user profiles, preferences, matches, messages, etc. Each model maps to a table in the PostgreSQL database.
API Development: RESTful APIs are developed using Django Rest Framework (DRF), simplifying the creation of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) endpoints. Authentication endpoints are also set up, using DRF's token authentication mechanism.
Testing and Migrations: Unit tests are written for each model and endpoint, ensuring the backend behaves as expected. Django migrations are used to apply model changes to the database schema.
Developing the Frontend
UI/UX Design: Initial mockups for the app’s interface are created, focusing on user experience and intuitive design. The team decides on the app’s color scheme, typography, and overall aesthetic.
Flutter Development: The team develops the app screens in Flutter, using widgets to create the UI elements for each page: login, registration, user profile, matching interface, chat interface, etc.
State Management: The app’s state management strategy is implemented, using Provider, Riverpod, or Bloc, to manage the app state, ensuring a responsive and interactive user experience.
Integration with Backend: The Flutter app is connected to the Django backend through HTTP requests. The team ensures secure communication using HTTPS and implements user authentication.
Testing
Backend Testing: Comprehensive tests for the Django backend include unit tests for models, integration tests for APIs, and security tests for authentication mechanisms.
Frontend Testing: The Flutter app undergoes widget testing (to test individual components), integration testing (to test complete flows), and performance testing.
Cross-Platform Testing: The app is tested on a wide range of devices and emulators to ensure consistent performance and appearance across different platforms and screen sizes.
Deployment and Launch
Backend Deployment: The Django backend is deployed to a cloud service, with environment variables securing sensitive information. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines are set up for automated testing and deployment.
Frontend Deployment: The Flutter app is built for production for both Android and iOS. The team navigates the app store submission process, including app review and compliance with guidelines.
Initial Launch: The app is launched with marketing efforts supporting its release. The team monitors initial user feedback and technical performance closely.
Continuous Improvement
User Feedback: The team collects and analyzes user feedback from app reviews, social media, and in-app surveys. This feedback highlights areas for improvement and new feature requests.
Performance Monitoring: Tools like Firebase Analytics and Sentry are integrated for real-time monitoring of app performance, tracking crashes, and identifying bottlenecks.
Iterative Development: Based on feedback and analytics, the development team prioritizes bug fixes, performance enhancements, and development of new features. Agile methodologies guide the iterative development process, with regular updates pushed to the app stores.
A/B Testing: New features and changes are often rolled out to a subset of users first. A/B testing frameworks help in evaluating the impact of these changes on user behavior and satisfaction.
