Flutter Setup: The team installs Flutter and configures it for both Android and iOS development, ensuring that the Dart SDK (which comes bundled with Flutter) is also set up.
Python and Django Setup: They set up a Python development environment, install Django, and create a new Django project to serve as the backend API.
PostgreSQL Setup: PostgreSQL is installed and configured. A new database is created for the app, and the necessary connections between Django and the database are established using Django's ORM.
